# MySecurePassword

My Secure Password 

My Secure Password was assignment given to me in my coding bootcamp class. This project was aimed to be able to generate the user a random password after the user has entered the criteria: how many characters 8-128, would the user like to use lowercase and/or uppercase characters, would the user like to use numbers, and would the user like to use special characters. I used given HTML, CSS and then had to code the program in JavaScript

I faced many challenges in this project mostly from being so green in javascript. But with trial error, patience and tutor help I was able to figure out the project. 

To run the password generator just visit:

I was helped in developing this project with code given to me by our UNCC coding bootcamp, my teacher Andrew Bautista, mulptiple teacher's assistants, and my tutor Trinh Nguyen.
